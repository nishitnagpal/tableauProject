## Project Description:
This project showcases a visually engaging and user-friendly dashboard created using Tableau. It features six dynamic visuals, including a line chart, histograms, a heat map, and an interactive map. Key functionalities include calendar and dropdown filters to explore house sales data by year, square footage, and lot size. The heat map reveals insights into view and condition quality, while histograms depict house prices and bedroom/bathroom distributions.
